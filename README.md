# ThreeTutorial
The notes and executable code documenting my
learning with [Three.js, the WebGL library](http://threejs.org/).
Though I think this library is super cool, I am in no way affiliated
with its creators and the content I create is in no way endorsed by
the people at Three.js. I'm just a dude, learning stuff, and putting
what I learn on the internet because I'm nice.

## Using and Exploring ThreeTutorial
Copy or fork this project as you would normally and open up the file called
"start.html" in your favorite [WebGL-compatible browser](http://caniuse.com/webgl "Common browsers
by WebGL compatibility").

## Current Progress
Just starting out; click on start.html to see the end product of the
"Getting Started" section on the Three.js website.
